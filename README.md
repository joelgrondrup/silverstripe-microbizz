## Installation

After building the database you should have a button in the CMS called "Microbizz Applications".
First create a Microbizz Application in the CMS and insert a public and secret key (contact [Ventu](https://micropedia.microbizz.com/tec/making-a-microbizz-app) commercial support for these keys).
